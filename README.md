## Description

This project was an attempt at showing the skills that I learned to program in C#. In this project I created several websites that are linked together to keep track of what the user has packed, needs to pack, and what they still need to buy in 3 unordered lists. Each entry in the lists are clickable to be able to view their properties. There is also a link at the bottom of the list page to add a new item entry to the list that will replace empty names for the items with the word "Nameless" and replace empty weights with 0.
